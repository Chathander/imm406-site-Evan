title: Research Question Prototype
order: 2

This project revisits the sketches, except the purpose is exploration of the hardware.

Create 1-3 sketches for the system, with a unique goal. Have a single hardware/technical question in your mind, and explore it until you are satisfied you will be able to present some insight.

Use a single project in a perforce depot.

Title the project with the constraint/question you are exploring, and take screenshots.
